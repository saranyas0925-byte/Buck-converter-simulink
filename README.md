# Study and Simulation of a DC–DC Buck Converter using MATLAB/Simulink
## Inspiration
 After a long academic gap,I slowly and steadily wanted to rebuild my foundation in power electronics.DC-DC buck converters are basic  blocks in electric vehicle systems.Hence I was motivated with  study and basic simulation of DC-DC converter matlab/simulink project which included voltage regulation,switching behaviour and graphical observation of system level operation.
